This is a software that I wrote in my 2nd-3rd year. It is written in C and Tcl/Tk. It was mostly written before I took my Algorithms course (in 3rd year 2nd sem), and some key data structure choices were made before I took data structure course. So, looking back I think, the code is pretty awful and can be improved many ways. 

This software tries to do something like Gephi, but only has few functionalities, like computing clustering co-efficient of a graph, answering shortest path queries etc. I spent many hours to implement the visualization in tk-canvas and complex event handling use-cases posed problems sometimes. So, the GUI components in TCL codes were sometimes very non-maintainable (I did not understand that then though).

There is a installation guide(documentation) in .pdf format. You can download it by right clicking "view raw" option and clicking "save link as..". It was developed in Ubuntu 10.04 and some packages may have been obsolete now though. I am yet to write a complete installation script as I did not deploy this software in many PCs. 

Feel free to contact me anytime if you need anything.
